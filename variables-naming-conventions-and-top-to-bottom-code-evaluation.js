Practice 1: Values, Data Types, and Operations - 2
variables-naming-conventions-and-top-to-bottom-code-evaluation.js

Objective:
In this activity, you will reinforce the skill of creating and using variables
while practicing best practices in variable naming conventions through a hands-on,
interactive coding challenge.

The code snippet below may include:
  - Ambiguous or incorrect variable names.
  - Missing variables that need to be created.
  - Scenarios that require the use of clear and descriptive variable names.

You will:
  - Identify Issues: Review the provided code and identify any variable names that:
  - Are unclear or too vague (e.g., a, b, c).
  - Do not follow best practices (e.g., camelCase, descriptive naming).
  - Refactor the Code: Rename the variables and rewrite the program using descriptive names that clearly convey the variable's purpose.
  - Enhance the Program: Add at least two additional variables to improve the programâ€™s functionality or clarity.

Things to reflect on:
  - Why is it important to use meaningful variable names?
  - What are the common pitfalls to avoid when naming variables?
  - How do clear variable names benefit team collaboration?

let name = "Alice";
let amount = 5;
let dollars = 20;
let cents = 38;
let pricePerItem = (dollars + cents / 100) / amount;
let final = name + " bought " + amount + " items for " + dollars + " dollars and " + cents + " cents for an average price of " + pricePerItem + " per item.";
console.log(final);

When trying to run code, make sure your terminal is in the correct directory.
I spent an unnecessary amount of time on this assignment because I could'nt figure that out.

Meaningful variable name help readers understand what is happening at each line.
Using "a, b, c, and d" doesn't explain to other developers what your code does.
Don't make the names too long. Make sure to use camel case to separate words in a name.
When all team members are able to read and follow along, more work is able to be completed within a shorter amount of time.
Having to constantly translate variable names can slow code production.
